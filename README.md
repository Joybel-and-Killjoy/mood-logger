Mood Logger/Tracker!

What's it do?:
This is a small web-based mood tracker (or logger) built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It's as simple as clicking a button to log your overall mood (happy, neutral, or sad) for the day. It logs your selection and shows you a visual of your choice by highlighting the current day within the month with its respective color.

Features:
Monthly calendar view
Mood logging with color-coded days
Dynamic date label (above mood buttons)

Why I built this:
Mainly, I wanted to create something interactive to help me practice real JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation. It was also my very first time dabbling with front-end UX and selection-based visuals.
I’ve always loved data and the ability to visualize it in an aesthetically pleasing manner! The idea of looking back at a month to see my overall mood kept me motivated to build/finish this little project.
(I'm quite proud of my first tiny (but powerful) little project).

Future/Next steps:
I am planning on adding:
Backend with Node.js and Firebase for saving data
Account creation/logins
Full year view
Different views (week, month, year)
Ability to log past days
